# Implementation of Extended Reality (XR) in teaching pedagogy for medical colleges

## Unreal App


In today’s life we prefer learning our concepts in a practical way instead of theoretical methods. While, many have access to hands-on training methodologies, there are still some fields of study who don’t possess it. Especially, medical science students for whom it is hard to obtain practical knowledge when being away from labs. Our team comes forward in researching an efficient application as a teaching pedagogy that uses an emerging concept of **Extended Reality (XR)** to give medical science students a new way of learning method without a physical mode, in turn they can present it in virtually. By referring to various laboratories, research papers and books. we plan to implement an interactive anatomy model with the help of XR binds with VR and AR which reacts to exact diseases in which the medical college student or a teacher can select a human body part and along with getting all the details about it. Moreover, they can also know how an organ gets affected by a disease and the timelapse of damage done by it, with the help of AR intends to XR. The application eases the way for the students and teachers with this sustainable pedagogy approach wherein gives the accurate results over Artificial and Realistic Anatomy of human culture.
